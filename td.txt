Short context:
	Tower defense game
	classic tiled 2D map with aerial view
	Monsters come from the outside of the map and will follow paths until reaching the base
	Monsters will inflict damage to the base when reaching it
	if the base has 0 health end of the game
	When a monster reach the base he's replaced outside of the map in the state he was before reaching the base
	Essences can be created and placed into buildings
	Essences will shoot on monsters
	Essences can be upgraded, fused, combined, decombined into powerfuler essences
	To buy/upgrade/fuse/combine essence, buy buildings, ect... it's required to have Energy
	Energy is gathered by time, by killing monster or by harvesting it with special essence effects

Essence:
	essence type
	damage
	reload_time							
	range
	special power
	kill_count
	level
	behavior

Monster:
	monster type
	damage									
	movement speed
	health point
	healing speed
	armor									reduce ALL incomming damage except pure damage by 100/(100+armor), cannot be negative
	size											

Specials game mechanics:
	Hit mechanic modification:
		splash 								hits inflict damage and effects on monsters at max special_power distance around the hit
		bouncing 							hits bounce on ceil(0.1*special_power) nearby units	
		flat armor reduction				reduce armor for 0.01*special_power per hit
		Beam 								reload_time decreased (1+0.01*special_power) times

	Hit effect:		
		multi hit 							frac(special_power)/trunc(0.01*special_power+1) + 1-(1/ trunc(0.01*special_power+1) ) chance of dealing trunc(0.01*special_power+1) the essence's damage
		flat DOT							inflicts special_power*damage in 3 second
		stun								frac(0.01*special_power)/trunc(0.01*special_power+1) + 1-(1/ trunc(0.01*special_power+1) ) chance of stun for trunc(0.01*special_power+1) seconds
		energy gathering					steals special_power energy per hit
		vulnerability						Each hit sets a stack of vulnerability, every hit of other towers will break one stack and deal 0.01*special_power more damage
		slow                                max slow 80%, slowed for (1 - ( 100/(100+special_power) )*0.8, add on hit, duration is 3 second

		growing stats on focus				increases damage for 1+(0.01*special_power) per hit on the same target
		growing stats on kill				increases damage definitively for 1+(0.001*special_power) per kill
		scaling DOT							inflicts 0.001*special_power % of the targets life in damage
		scaling armor reduction				reduces armor by 0.01*special_power % of targets armor, stackable per essence, not per hit, applies before flat armor reduction





Essence types:
	earth									bouncing
	air										flat armor reduction
	water									beam
	fire									splash

	ice 		water + air					stun
	magma		earth + fire				flat DOT
	lightning	fire + air					multi hit
	vapor		fire + water				energy gathering
	sand		earth + air					
	mud			earth + water				slow

	darkness	water + fire + earth		scaling DOT
	light		air + fire + earth			scaling armor reduction
	life		water + air + earth			growing stats on focus
	death		water + fire + air			growing stats on kill

Essence fusion:
	fuse element to create other elements
	Average of all characteristics

	Combine element to add their special effects
	Average of all characteristics
	Essences can be uncombined 

Essence targeting behavior:
